    "desc": ".Ethereum Jungle II depicts Vitalik Buterin in a Utopia of botanical glitched colour. In this artwork, Harman merges a digital composition with leftover oil paint; pushing, pulling and drawing the images through the surplus paint to create ridges and allowing the paint to smear and drip. The over-painting of digital images reference Richter whilst the distorted figuration echoes Bacon and Frank Auerbach. Within the corruption of the digital image, there is a breaking up of the information, which leaves the viewer to interpret the space between abstraction and figuration.",
